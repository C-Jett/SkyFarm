## SkyFarm
A simple farm application that implements pre-built farms into a JavaFX view. Meant to learn and experiment with important software design patterns.

# Original GitLab link
Instead of just forking the project I added various changes including importing the project into Maven. To preserve the project we
turned in I created this new repository.

# Contributions
The following people contributed various amounts to the project in our class.
* Adam Agee
* Ramiz Midani
* Jamal Cooper
* Andrew Yarbrough

# Instructions
All of the farms are imported inside of the skyfarm.list file. If you wish to load up a new farm, importing a CSV file with the correct format will do.
